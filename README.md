### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this lesson, I learned about AJAX. AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It allows programmers to load data from the server without a browser page refresh. It makes XML/JSON, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript run more efficient. 
2. In this lesson, I also learned about JSON. It stands for JavaScript Object Notation and XML. It is a  lightweight text-based open standard designed for humanreadable data interchange. 
3. Another thing I learned in this lesson was an API key. It is a code passed in by computer programs calling an API to identify the calling program, its developer, or its user to the Web site.
